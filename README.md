## SwiftOtter's Associate Developer Project Guide

Welcome to the most practical resource on beginning Magento development. The end result of this is to
 take (and pass) the Magento 2 Associate Developer certification. This course is developed by
 [Joseph Maxwell](https://swiftotter.com/team/joseph), a 2019 Magento Master. He has written hundreds of pages of test-prep material.
 
 This course is 
comprised of several parts:
* The code (here). Feel free to use this as a template or reference, but please do not use it
as a "copy, paste and pass" tool—as *that will not work*.
* The [project guide PDF](https://swiftotter.com/media/associate-project-guide.pdf). This is a detailed
and in-depth guide that walks you through how to complete this project. It's not a "do this", but rather,
it gives you the reasons why to do this and how to find the solution yourself.
* The [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFTzkGZAz4&list=PLrW94TMW-eohnHkJuKzJm2RPhbqfMbDjd).
 This walks you through everything you need to know to get the job done. Seriously, this is my
 commentary and thoughts around building out each step of the implementation. Videos are released weekly.
* The [study guide / practice test](https://swiftotter.com/technical/certifications/magento-2-certified-associate-study-guide).
This is the final level of study for the Associate Developer certification.

If you intentionally work through each of the above steps, there is no reason why you would fail
the test. But, this is a large investment of your time and will likely take several or more months
to complete.

Yet, please do it—for your own sake and your family's sake. You will forever thank yourself.
